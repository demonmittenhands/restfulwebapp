How big can a node name be? (assumed 250 characters)
Can it contain all foreign characters? 
The "Provide basic input validation and return meaningful errors" requirement. 
    What constitues a valid input? I'm only checking for duplicate nodes, but I'd want some more info there.

Could child nodes have the same name as parent nodes? 

Couldn't get GSON or JSON libraries to play nice with my controller so I'm doing some not great casting to HashMaps. 
It works and I'm sure I'm missing an import or configuration for VS code

Lombok won't work inside of tests, so even though I've used @Setter/@Getter/@Data I'm stuck writing getters/setters myself anyway.
