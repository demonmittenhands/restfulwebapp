How big can a node name be? (assumed 250 characters)
Can it contain all foreign characters? 
The "Provide basic input validation and return meaningful errors" requirement. 
    What constitues a valid input? I'm only checking for duplicate nodes, but I'd want some more info there.

Could child nodes have the same name as parent nodes?
